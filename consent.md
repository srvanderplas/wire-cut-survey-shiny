# Basic Information

* **IRB Project ID #**: 23338 

* **Study Title:** Forensics of Wire Cuts: DIY Shop Tool Survey

# Research Description

## Purpose

The purpose of this research is to understand the range and quantity of wire cutting tools available in tool collections of the do it yourself (DIY) community in order to estimate how likely it is that a coincidental match between a tool and a piece of cut wire in evidence may occur during a forensic investigation.

## Participation Restrictions

If you are over the age of 19, you may participate in this research. 

## Time Committment

Participation in this study will require approximately 1 hour of your time. This estimate is based on the size of the investigator's tool collection. The study may take you more or less time depending on the size and organization of your tool collection. 

## Procedures

You will be asked to assemble all tools you have which may be used for cutting wires. We will ask you to measure the length of the cutting surface and record additional information about the tool, such as the number of cutting surfaces and the type of tool.

## Location

Participation will take place wherever you store your tools.

## Risks and Benefits

There are no identified risks to your participation in this experiment.

You may benfit from participation in this research by learning about toolmark comparisons, but other than that there are no material benefits to you for participating.

Society may benefit because this study will increase our understanding of the likelihood that a match between a cut wire and a tool occurs due to random chance or the number of comparisons performed during the investigative process. 

You will not be compensated for your participation in this study.

## Privacy

Reasonable steps will be taken to protect the privacy and the confidentiality [or anonymity] of your study data; however, in some circumstances we cannot guarantee absolute privacy and/or confidentiality. At no point will we collect any data which is identifiable to you. 
Research records will be stored electronically on university machines. Records will only be seen by the research team and/or those authorized to view, access, or use the records during the study. Once the study is complete, the anonymous data will be published as part of the process of publishing scientific results.
