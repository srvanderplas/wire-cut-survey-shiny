## Background Information

During a forensic investigation, investigators may look at microscopic imperfections in a surface left by the use of a tool (e.g. crowbar, bolt cutters, etc.). 
These marks often take the form of striations - little lines that are on the surface of the mark. 
A common macroscopic example of striations are the lines left behind when you spread butter or jam on toast.
A 3D scan of a cut wire is shown in @fig-wire-striae; striations are visible along the wire surface.

Tools can leave different striations depending on where and how the material contacts the tool. 
As a result, in order to compare a mark to a tool, a forensic examiner must make comparisons along the entire surface of the tool's edge. 
This study aims to understand exactly how much comparison material individuals might have at home under normal circumstances. 
In an investigation, examiners would have to assess all of the tools in someone's possession in order to link them to evidence at the crime scene.




## Preparation

Collect any tools you have that you might use under normal circumstances to: 

1. cut a wire, or
2. pry two things apart (for example, open a jammed door)

For instance, surveying @fig-shop-layout, we would include scissors and box cutters under item 1, and we might include hammers under item 2. 
The metric is whether *you, personally* would use this tool under a *normal* (e.g. not an emergency) situation to accomplish the stated task. 
It does not matter whether the tool is intended for the task.

A messy garage workbench and tool storage area. Locating only easily available tools is sufficient for this task.

In some situations, this may include tools such as cat/dog nail clippers, chisels, or wire strippers. 
If you like to improvise, then for the purposes of this study, please **don't** include things like rocks or teeth (both examples from a friend) - pretend you're a sensible person and not an engineer in a hurry.


It is fine to only measure available or easily located tools - this is an estimation task.
@fig-tool-examples shows tools which might be used for each of the two tasks, assembled from those easily located in the workspace shown in @fig-shop-layout.
