[Survey] Is your tool collection criminally large?

Hi, Reddit! I'm a statistician who works with forensic pattern comparison data to try to make the field more quantitative. I am currently interested in understanding how likely a false positive error is, if someone is relatively "handy" and has a few tools for hobbies, DIY activities, etc. To understand this risk, I'd like to know about the tools that you have laying around.

If you are at least 19 years old, and are interested in this topic, please complete the survey [here](https://shiny.srvanderplas.com).
