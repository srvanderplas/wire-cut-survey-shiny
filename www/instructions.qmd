This project will help us assess the likelihood of a random tool matching a toolmark of a given size in evidence, and to examine the probability that an innocent person is accused of committing a crime on the basis of such a match.

## Tool Inclusion Criteria

To participate, collect any tools you have that you might use to: 

1. cut a wire, or
2. pry two things apart (for example, open a jammed door)

under normal circumstances. For instance, surveying @fig-shop-layout, we would include scissors and box cutters under item 1, and we might include hammers under item 2. The metric is whether *you, personally* would use this tool under a *normal* (e.g. not an emergency) situation to accomplish the stated task. 

In some situations, this may include tools such as cat/dog nail clippers, chisels, or wire strippers. If you like to improvise, then for the purposes of this study, please **don't** include things like rocks or teeth (both examples from a friend) - pretend you're a sensible person and not an engineer in a hurry.

It is fine to only measure available tools - e.g. the ones that are easily located. There is no need to go digging to find every tool - this is an estimation task.

## Background Information

### Toolmarks

During a forensic investigation, investigators may look at microscopic imperfections in a surface left by the use of a tool (e.g. crowbar, bolt cutters, etc.). These marks often take the form of striations - little lines that are on the surface of the mark. A macroscopic example that is more relateable is when you spread butter or jam on toast, the butter knife often leaves little grooves behind in the spread[^2].
A 3D scan of a cut wire is shown in @fig-wire-striae; striations are visible along the wire surface. 

![Striations on the surface of a cut wire.](wire-striae.png){#fig-wire-striae fig-width="50%"}


Tools can leave different striations depending on where the material contacts the tool. As a result, in order to compare a mark to a tool, a forensic examiner must make comparisons along the entire surface of the tool's edge. 

## Cutting Surfaces

Most cutting tools have at least 2 edges; some may have 4. @fig-tool-surfaces shows some common configurations of tool blades along with example tools that have that configuration. 
It is important to record both the length of the blade/cutting surface and the number of cutting surfaces for this study, as examiners would have to compare all lengths of all cutting surfaces to determine whether the tool was used to make the mark recovered from the crime scene.


![Different tool configurations. On the top row, there are cross-sectional shapes representing the blades; each cutting surface that will leave a residual mark on the cut material is numbered. On the bottom, there are examples of tools with this configuration of blades (note that not all similar looking tools are necessarily configured the same).](surface-counts.png){#fig-tool-surfaces}

## Prying Surfaces

Many prying tools have multiple ways to use the tool. 
For the purposes of this study, we are interested in any end of the tool which is intended to push between two surfaces. 
For these tools, it is important to record the length of each surface separately. An example is shown in @fig-pry-surfaces.

![This tool has three different surfaces configured for prying tow objects apart. Each surface should be measured separately.](hammer-pry-surfaces.png){#fig-pry-surfaces}

Some tools may have a claw; that is, there may be a gap between two regions, intended for e.g. removing nails. As shown in @fig-measure-claw, measure the length of the full surface as if the claw were not present, and then mark the measurement as having a claw.

![Measuring a clawed tool. Measure the entire linear prying surface, including the space where the claw is present. Record the size of the gap as the claw length. If there is no claw, enter 0 as the claw length.](measure-claw.png){#fig-measure-claw}



## Data Collection Steps:

1.  Gather tools which can be used for wire cutting or prying from your house and shop.

2.  In the wire cutting tab, you will record the following information for each type of tool:

    -   tool type/description (e.g. "pliers", "needlenose pliers", "wire strippers")

    -   blade length in cm

    -   number of cutting surfaces on the tool

    -   number of tools (if you have more than one of the same approximate type/size).

3. In the prying tab, you will record the following information for each prying surface. 

    - tool type/description
    
    - prying surface length in cm
    
    - whether the prying surface is split (e.g. whether this is a claw)

There may be multiple entries per tool if a tool has multiple prying surfaces. 
    
4.  When you are finished recording your tools, hit the Submit button to save your data to the database.

Thank you so much for your help!
